laundr.me: The Unified Super-App for the Side Hustle Economy
Overview
laundr.me is the essential, all-in-one digital toolkit for the modern freelancer and gig worker. Our mission is to deliver the undisputed super-app that defines the new economy by seamlessly integrating a talent marketplace, a payment network, a booking engine, and client management tools into a single, frictionless experience. The application is powered by a multi-tiered autonomous AI workforce that constantly monitors and improves security, operations, and user satisfaction.
The application is a hybrid of best-in-class service apps:
 * Yelp + TaskRabbit: A dynamic, trusted marketplace to discover, rate, and book talent. The app serves as a digital storefront for freelancers, empowering them with a professional profile and a clear, user-friendly interface for clients to find and engage them based on skills, reviews, and availability.
 * Venmo + Cash App: A viral, lightning-fast P2P payment network. Financial transfers are officially called "loads". The "Loads" tab is designed to be the fastest way to move money, making financial transfers instant and easy.
 * Calendly: A seamless, intuitive scheduling engine. The Bookings Calendar provides a shared view of availability, eliminating the back-and-forth of email chains and messages.
 * QuickBooks: A lightweight financial command center for solopreneurs. The Activity/History tab and its tax export feature give freelancers a simple, centralized tool to manage their income and expenses related to their side hustles.
 * Zoho: A simplified CRM for managing client relationships. The lightweight CRM allows users to save contacts and add private notes, which is crucial for building and maintaining a professional client list over time.
Technical Architecture
Our development philosophy is "build first and open-source second" to maximize velocity and ownership.
 * Frontend: React Native with TypeScript.
 * Backend: Python (Flask).
 * Database: PostgreSQL for persistent data like user profiles, transactions, and appointments.
 * Cache: Redis for session management and real-time features.
 * DevOps: The entire stack is containerized with Docker and designed for deployment on a PaaS like Heroku or AWS Free Tier.
 * Security: We utilize JWT for API authentication, Bcrypt for password hashing, and SSL/TLS for all data in transit. All user-facing changes require human approval via a dedicated CI/CD gate before deployment.
