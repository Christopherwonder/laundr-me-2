You are an expert backend software engineer. Your task is to implement the Activity feed and analytics dashboard API for the laundr.me application.

**Core Requirements:**
1.  **Implement Activity Feed:** Create an endpoint that provides a reverse-chronological list of all user transactions (Loads, Swaps) and booking events.
2.  **Implement Analytics Endpoints:** Create endpoints to provide aggregated data for the analytics dashboard, including:
    - Revenue broken down by client or service type.
    - Income trends.
    - Projections based on confirmed future bookings.
3.  **Build Financial Report Export:** Create an endpoint that generates a CSV file formatted to be compatible with Schedule C and standard accounting software like QuickBooks or Xero.
4.  **Write Unit Tests:** Write tests with a pre-seeded dataset to validate the accuracy of the analytics aggregations and the correctness of the CSV export format.
